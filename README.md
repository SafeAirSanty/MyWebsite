<p>In 1994, Cuban people demonstrated incredible resilience as they built large rafts with the help of their townspeople. The community would come togetber to carry these big rafts to the coast, showcasing their unity and determination in the face of challenging circumstances. My fascination with rafts started in my early years. Inspired by the tales of the Cuban Exodus of 1994, I decided to build my own raft using an inner tube from a bus. With the support of my friends and famil, we gathered materials and constructed a sturdy vessel that was ready to face the open ocean. I spent three days navigating the vast ocean, encountering incredible marine life along the way. I witnessed the majesty of sharks, the playful nature of dolphins and even caught a glimpse of whales in the deep ocean. This experience taught me the importance of resilience, teamwork, and the power of shared goals. it was an unforgettable adventure filled with challenges and awe-inspiring moments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Personal Story </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything started whe I joined the Cuban Army at the age of 17. It was a time when the dictator Fidel Castro established mandatory military service (Servicio).  Soon afte, I was sent to Angola as part of the African war effor, which was supposed to last two years, Arriving in Luanda, the capital of Angola üá¶üá¥, I was taken aback by the sheer beauty of the country. It was my first time leaving Cuba, and I felt a mix of confusion and fear as I heard explosions in the distance, unsure of what to think.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 17, I had come with the belief that we were there to help the Angolan people, but those hopes were shattered when I realized they didn't want us there. We often trekked through the jungle, exchanging canned food for hot üî• meals with the local community. The told us their food was intended for the other soldier, particularly those from UNITA and the South African Army. I confided in my friend Ramon that we were fighting the wrong war. Many of my friends lost their lives, and the realization set in that we were unwanted defenders, paid only 7 Cuban pesos, while Castro earned $25,00000 for every soldier soldier sent. One day, I decided to escape and cross the border between Angola and Namibia. Ramon warned me of the dire consequences if I got caught, but determined, I set out through the jungle. I encountered lions, tigers, elephants, and other dangerous creatures. After hours of wandering. I got lost and was eventually found by a Cuban truck before I could reach the border. I claimed I was lost after using the bathroom, and they returned me to the camp. I had tried my best. A few months later, I took a cadet course for military school in Cuba, hoping for a chance to return home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After passing the test, I was flown back to Cuba and straight to the academy. I longed to see my family, but my plan was to escape from the academy. I seized the first opportunity, ran away, and hitchhiked home. My mother was overjoyed, knowing so many Cuban mothers had lost their children in the war. I shared my story, and she fought for my freedom, ultimately securing my release after three months in military prison. However, my inferno was just beginning. Life became unbearable as they refused to give me a job, and I was repeatedly arrested without cause.</p>

<p>Determined, I built in other raft, plotting my escape. After observing the beach security, I made my move, I was caught, they started to beat me up, and interrogated, accused of being an American spy. twelve days of torture, I was imprisoned for three years. Upon release, the Cuban Exodus began, I constructed another raft with the help of four friends, gathering a gallon of water and 12 rolls of bread, we heard that US Coast Guard would rescue us at 13 miles from Cuba üá®üá∫ means that we don't need to much food and water, but they left and we were adrift for three days, even we rescued a Cuban man who had been in the ocean for two weeks, he had lost all eight companions. We encountered sharks ü¶à, dolphins üê¨, whales üêã, and various ocean creatures. Tropical storms battered us, and started illusionary about store my friends was watching me because I talked about go to the store to get something to drink and eat, when I was ready to jump in the ocean my friends hold me and tied me up with the rope, A shark ü¶à followed us for a long time, adding to our fear.</p>
