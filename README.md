<p>In 1994, Cuban people demonstrated incredible resilience as they built large rafts with the help of their townspeople. The community would come together to carry these big rafts to the coast, showcasing their unity and determination in the face of challenging circumstances. My fascination with rafts started in my early years. inspired by the tales of the Cuban people's determination during the Cuban Exodus of 1994, I decided to build my own raft using an inner tube from a bus. With the support of my friends and family, we gathered materials and constructed a sturdy vessel that was ready to face the open ocean. I spent three days navigating the vast ocean, encountering incredible marine life along the way. I witnessed the majesty of sharks, the playful nature of dolphins, and even caught a glimpse of whales in the deep ocean. This experience taught me the importance of resilience,teamwork, and the power of shared goals. It was an unforgettable adventure filled with challenges and awe-inspiring moments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Personal Story</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything started when I joined the Cuban Army at the age 17. It was a time when the dictator Fidel Castro established mandatory military service (Servicio Militar Obligatorio). Soon after, I was sent to Angola as part of the African war effort, which was supposed to last two years, Arriving in Luanda, the capital of Angola üá¶üá¥, I was taken aback by the sheer beauty of the country. It was my first time leaving Cuba, and I felt a mix of confusion and fear as I heard explosions in the distance, unsure of what to think.</p>

<p>At 17, I had come with the belief that we were there to help the Angolan people, but those hopes were shattered when I realized they didn't want us there. We often trekked through the jungle, exchanging canned food for hot meals with the local community. They told us their food was intended for the other soldiers, particularly those from UNITA and the South African Army. I confided in my friend Ramon that we were fighting the wrong war. Many of my friends lost their lives, and the realization set in that we were unwanted defenders, paid only 7 Cuban pesos, while Castro earned $25,000 for every soldier sent. One day I decided to escape and cross the border between Angola and Namibia. Ramon warned me of the dire consequences if I got caught, but determined, I set out through the jungle. I encountered lions, tigers, elephants, and other dangerous creatures. After hours of wandering, I got lost and was eventually found by a Cuban truck before I could reach the border, I claimed I was lost after using the bathroom, and they returned me to the camp. I had tried my best. A few months later, I took a cadet course for military school in Cuba, hoping for a chance to return home.</p>

<p>After passing the test, I was flown back to Cuba and straight to the academy. I longed to see my family, but my plan was to escape from the academy. I seized the first opportunity, ran away, and hitchhiked home. My mother was overjoyed, knowing so many Cuban mothers had lost their children in the war. I shared my story, and she fought for my freedom, ultimately securing my release after three months in military prison. However, my inferno was just beginning. Life become unbearable as they refused to give me a job, and I was repeatedly arrested without cause.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My Oceanic Adventure </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Determined, I built my own raft, plotting my escape. After observing the beach security, I made my move, but was caught, beaten, and interrogated, accused of being an American spy, Twelve days of torture later, I was imprisoned for three years. Upon release, The Cuban Exodus began. I constructed another raft with the help of four friends, gathering a gallon of water and 12 rolls of bread. We had little food, believing the US Coast Guard would rescue us 13 miles from Cuba üá®üá∫, but it wasn't. We were adrift for three days, without food or water by the first day. We rescued a Cuban man who had been in the ocean for two weeks; he had lost all eight companions.We encountered sharks ü¶à, dolphins üê¨, whales üêã,and various ocean creatures. Tropical storms battered us,and we tied ourselves to the raft to avoid being swept away. A shark ü¶à followed us for a long time, adding to our fear. </p>

<p>By the morning of the third day, hunger and the harsh conditions were overwhelming. Exhausted, I fell asleep, only to be awakened by the sound of a horn. It was the US Coast Guard, and seeing the United States of America üá∫üá∏, we screamed in relief.</p>
